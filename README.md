A basic <strong>Vite</strong> (React + Tailwind) project. Made this to practice react and also to learn how to configure stuff using vite!

---

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
